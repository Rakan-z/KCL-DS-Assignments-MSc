# KCL-Data-Science,
This repository consists of folders which include some of the courseworks I have completed in my Data Science MSc at KCL. Each folder contains courseworks from a specific module listed below.

PNN
- 
- Module Title: Pattern Recognition, Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Module Objective: To provide an introduction to pattern recognition, neural networks and deep learning covering the basic principles and main techniques and methods, with an emphasis on solving classification problems using supervised learning.

DM
- 
- Module Title: Data Mining
- Module Objective: The aim of this module is for students to gain a comprehensive understanding of the field of Data Mining and its application to real-world problems and data sets. Data mining methodologies include classification, clustering and modelling of data, as well as testing and prediction based on data. Students will learn how to make effective use of these methodologies, determining which algorithms are appropriate for given data sets and problems, pre-processing raw data for analysis and implementing algorithms using a high-level programming language (such as Python). Upon successful completion of the module, students will be prepared to perform data mining tasks using real-world data sets.
