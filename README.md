# MSc Courseworks - PNN
This repository consists of files which include reports of some of the courseworks I have completed in my MSc module: Pattern Recognition, Neural Networks, and Deep Learning. Each file is described in the below sections.

SVM.pdf
- 
- Grade: 94/100
- Coursework description: This assignment provides the overall classification idea from samples to design to classification. It helps you to make clear the concept, working principle, theory, classification of samples, design procedure and multiple-class classification techniques for SVM (Support Vector Machines).

Ensemble.pdf
- 
- Grade: 90/100
- Coursework description: This assignment goes through the detailed steps of handling classification problem using ensemble methods. You have full control of the datasets which is not the case in real scenarios but allows you to achieve the design easier with a small size of dataset. Through this assignment, it helps you to make clear the concept, working principle, theory, classification of samples, design procedure and multiple-class classification techniques using ensemble methods.
